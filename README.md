# Personal Color Detection using Machine Learning (The 4 Seasons Theory)

## Overview
The **Personal Color Detection** project applies machine learning to determine an individual's personal color based on the 4 Seasons Theory: **Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter**. This project combines image processing techniques and classification algorithms to analyze facial features and skin tones, providing personalized color recommendations.

## Problem Statement
Determining personal colors is a subjective process traditionally performed by experts. This project aims to develop a machine learning solution that automates and standardizes this process by analyzing visual data and classifying individuals into one of the four seasons.

## Dataset
We use Deep Armocromia Dataset at https://github.com/lorenzo-stacchio/Deep-Armocromia 

You can take path for D
